# Trivia App

## Overview

The **Trivia App** is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo. This app allows users to test their knowledge across various categories through True / False trivia questions. The questions are fetched from an open trivia API, providing a diverse range of topics and difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Multiple Categories**: Choose from a wide range of trivia categories such as General Knowledge, Science, History, and more.
- **Dynamic Question Fetching**: Questions are fetched in real-time from an external API, ensuring a fresh experience every time.
- **Progress Tracking**: See how well youâ€™re doing as you progress through the quiz.
- **Detailed Results**: Review your performance at the end of each quiz.

## Future Improvements

There are a few enhancements that I plan to implement when time permits:

### 1. **Light/Dark Theme Support**
   - **Description**: Integrating a light/dark theme toggle will enhance the user experience by allowing users to switch between light and dark modes depending on their preference or system settings.

### 2. **Internationalization (i18n) with `react-i18next`**
   - **Description**: Implementing internationalization (i18n) will enable the app to support multiple languages, making it accessible to a broader audience. Using `react-i18next` will provide a robust solution for managing translations and localization.
